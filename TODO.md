TODO list
===============
* remove not used functions and calls
* remove time from popup dialog
* Verify if root layers with transforms are working correctly
* May need to check layer/shape name uniqueness before creating the export
* Figure out the rectangle tangents issue that happens sometimes:    Draw a rectangle bezier and the tangets will be exported swapped.
* Layer opacity is a multiplier to the child shapes opacity
* Layers may need additional attributes otherwise you can't delete them on silhouette

* SOLVED (with error msg) - Sometimes if elements are selected oin the roto node, script fails
